# As with js.yaml, we can load TypeScript files as well from any tree. You can
# change the site.ori to use this file by changing the `js` folder reference to
# `ts.yaml`. The result will be the same.

app.ts: |
  import greet from "./hello.ts";
  console.log(greet("world"));

hello.ts: |
  export default function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
