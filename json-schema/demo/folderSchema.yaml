# Schema for the posts folder
#
# This schema enforces these rules:
#
# 1. Only files with .md extension are allowed
# 2. Each markdown file must have a title and a body
# 3. The title and body must be non-empty strings
#
# This is in JSON Schema format but written in YAML for readability

# The posts folder will appear to the validator as an object
type: object

# A pattern property is a schema applied to object keys (here, file names)
patternProperties:
  # File names in the posts folder must end in a `.md` extension
  "\\.md$":
    # The value (the markdown content) must comply with our post schema
    $ref: ./postSchema.yaml

# No other types of property (file) names are allowed in the posts folder
additionalProperties: false
